# me_575_Final_Project

Creating a folder from which to implement yfinance library

## How to get started

1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository to your local machine
2. Open the repository in your favorite IDE
3. Create a [new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) for your work. This will help us keep track of who is working on what.
4. Create a python virtual environment to install the dependencies that you need. In VSCode, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and typing `Python: Create New Environment`. You can also do this in the terminal by running `python -m venv env`.
5. Activate the virtual environment. In VSCode, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and typing `Python: Select Interpreter`. You can also do this in the terminal by running `source env/bin/activate`.
6. Install the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal. (Unless you've already installed the dependencies when prompted to do so in VSCode in the previous step.)
7. You should be able to run the code now.

> **Note:** If you are concerned that a "patrickwalton" committed to the repo, then don't worry, it was a weird technical glitch where my Boss' account credentials were used from my dual booted laptop and it's difficult to change the user data.
